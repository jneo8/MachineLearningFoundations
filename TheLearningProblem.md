# The Learning Problem


- 從基礎開始切入
    - what every machine learning user should know
    - Story-like
        - When Can Machines Learn?
        - Why Can Machines Learn?
        - How Can Machines Learn?
        - How Can Machines Learn Better?

    - *Allow students to learn 'feature/untaught' techniques or study deeper theory easily*


## When Can Machines Learn?

- 學習是從觀察出發

    - `Observations` -> `Learning` -> `skill`

    - 用電腦來模擬類似的過程

        - `data` -> `ML` -> `skill`

- Skill
    - improve some performance measure
    - ML
        - `data` -> `ML` -> `improved performance measure`
    - An Application in Computational Finance
        - `stock data` -> `data` -> `move investment gain`

- Yet Another Application: Tree recognition
    - ML: an `alternative route` to build complicated systems

- Some Use Scenarios
    - When human connot program the system manually
        - navigating on Mars
    - When human cannot defince the solution easily
        - speech/visual recognition
    - When needing rapid decisions that humans connot do
        - high-frequency trading
    - When needing to be-user-oriented in a massive scale
        - consumer-targeted marketing

- Key Essence of ML
    - exists *some underlying pattern to be learned* - so *performance measure* can be improved
    - But *no* programmable (easy) *definition*
    - Somehow there is data about the pattern


## Application of Machine learning

- Dailyneed 食衣住行育樂

    - Food
        - data: Twitter(word + location)
        - skill: 判斷食物中毒
    - clothing 
        - data: sales figures + client surveys
        - skill: 如何搭配衣服
    - Housing
    - Transportation
        - 自動車
    - Education

- Entertainment: Recommender System
    - data: how many users have rated some movies
    - skill: predict how a user would rate an unrated movie

## Components of ML

- unknow pattern to be learned
    - *approve credit card good for bank*

- ## Basic Notations
    - input x (customer application)

    - output y (good/bad after approving credit card)

    - *target function*
        - f x -> y

    - data:
        - D = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2)]

    - hypothesis <-> skill
        - *g*: x -> y

    - 機器學習就是從 hypothsis set (H) 中取得最像 f 的 g
    - learning model = A & H
    - 從資料出發算出一個 g(假說) 最接近我們心中所想的f(不知道但最佳)
